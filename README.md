# Prusa i3 Y-carriage Camera Mount

This Camera Mount is designed to hold a Papalook PA452 1080P webcam in a smaller custom case on the Y-carriage.

It allows the camera to move with the build plate and allows for smooth Timelapses without worrying about the position of the Extruder too much.
It is also pleasant to watch the live stream of the webcam.

It has been designed with as minimum supports as needed.
They are already incorporated in the design or configured in the F3D files.

To assemble the Camera Mount you will need to do the following steps:
- Print parts
- Remove supports from the parts
- Disassemble the camera from the original case (voids the warranty)
- Desolder the LED and Switch from the camera
- Mount the camera in the new case (microphone is not needed)
- Add the new Lens
- Mount the Camera Case on the arm
- Push the arm on the Y-carriage (I mounted it on the left side, should work on the right side as well)
- Route the cables under the Y carriage to the heatbed cables. Make sure they don't touch the heatbed when securing them with cable ties later!
- Wrap all the cables together in the sleeve and remove the camera cable shortly before the electronics from the sleeve
- Secure everything with cable ties. Make sure the Y carriage is able to move freely!
- Enjoy the new view of your printer
